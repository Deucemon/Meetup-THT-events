So we chose Getting started with Freelancing as a topic.</p> <p>Freelance The Hague is for freelancers in all fields, from developers to marketeers to designers to project managers. If we team up we can share, learn en improve. And make some new friends :)</p> <p>The first meetup is about Getting Started. As a freelancer you have to run a business on your own, so this can be quite challenging in the beginning. And if you already run smoothly, maybe you have other goals or some valuable tips.</p> <p>We will start with a central talk about Getting Started with Freelancing. Then we will partner up and do some exercises. Afterwards youâ€™ll have a chance to mingle.</p> <p>It will be at the Nomadz coworking space in Bink36.
