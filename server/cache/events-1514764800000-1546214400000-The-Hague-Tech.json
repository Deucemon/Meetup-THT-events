Find out the most important changes for your organisation.</p> <p>The GDPR is a law that applies to all businesses that process the personal data of EU citizens. The law was developed because the EU wishes to create a uniform, secure, European digital environment. As soon as a company processes personal data, the people concerned must have access to their own data. It must be easy to rectify mistakes in one’s own data. Furthermore, it must be possible to delete and export data.</p> <p>It seems that 97% of companies don’t have a plan in place for when GDPR kicks off in 2018, while it will have implications on marketing and sales activities. Would you like to know how prepared your organisation is regarding the legal AVG / GDPR requirements, and how to prepare from them? Cor den Boer and Jeremy Bode (ICT Architect) and (Senior Data Protection Officer bij DPO Consultancy) will prepare you for the new privacy regulations.</p>","how_to_find_us":"Please find \"Olga\" on the tablet and she will open the door for you.
