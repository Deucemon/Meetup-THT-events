I've managed to get the support of the Hague Tech, which will be a great location [www.thehaguetech.nl] as there are a lot of other very interesting things going on there.</p> <p>The time I have set is between 19:00 and 21:00 so as to allow for travel after work and the date [Thursday 30 August] allows us to get the first Meetup organised as soon as possible after the main summer holidays.</p> <p>At the moment I am hoping, we start with some introductions followed by two 30 minute presentations with discussions. Possible topics are:</p> <p>- Cyber issues in Intelligence and Analysis<br/>- Introduction to non-standard data types [IoT, Cyber, Network]<br/>- Ergonomics of Intelligence Analysis [soft skills and leadership]<br/>- Open Source Intelligence [OSINT]</p> <p>Please send me your views [I want to include everyone on this community and also the time slot [there is a possibility to organise this Meetup for the same day between 17:00 and 19:00].</p> <p>I'll add to this post closer to the time of the Meetup.</p> <p>Looking forward to meeting you, so please sign up!</p> <p>Best wishes,</p> <p>Ammi</p>","how_to_find_us":"We have chosen this location as it is very central [5 minute walk from Central Station]. Hopefully will enable the porfessionals in nearby cities to attend. The Hague Tech also has a relaxed atmosphere and I'll try to organise drinks and bites.
