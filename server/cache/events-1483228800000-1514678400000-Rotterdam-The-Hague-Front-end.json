The thing is that there is a distinct difference between the two, which is the cause of many misconceptions of what the job actually entails. In this talk we will go into what the differences are and how better understand the role that each play in the products we make. Hopefully, through this we will be able to demystify the job a little bit and in turn become better at it.</p> <p>Hidde de Vries<br/><b>Hiding content</b><br/>Most modern front-end builds contain bits of hidden content.
