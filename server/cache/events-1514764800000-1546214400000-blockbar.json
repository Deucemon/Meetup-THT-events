In this workshop, you will learn to set up your own liquidity provider and become your own market maker. You will learn how to trade using atomic swaps on the decentralized exchange BarterDEX running from your very own Raspberry Pi.</p> <p>Built by Komodo, the world-leader in atomic swap technology, BarterDEX offers a decentralized tool (dApp) that allows anyone to make a coin conversion request of bitcoin- and Ethereum based tokens, finding a suitable match and complete the trade using an atomic cross-chain protocol. An atomic swap is a peer-to-peer trade of one cryptocurrency directly for another, without any direct IP contact between the two nodes or the use of an intermediary party.</p> <p>Curious how the future of instant wallet-to-wallet trading will be?
