We're going to dig into what it took to migrate 280TB of data the Naturalis museum in Leiden had from tapes into Amazon Glacier. We will go over the planning, execution, monitoring, verification, and closing out of this project. We'll share our knowledge and lessons learned which you can use as a starting point to do your own data migration.</p> <p>Speaker: Ionut Dragoi (ex-Amazon Web Services Managed Services)<br/>Title: Unit-testing for Boto3, the AWS python library<br/>Description: We all know that testing the code we write is very important.<br/>This is because we want to make sure that the code is actually doing what it is supposed to.<br/>When it comes to complex systems, made up of multiple services interacting with each other,<br/>the first tests that comes to mind are the functional, integration tests, that make sure the whole system is working as expected using real input and output. But how about testing smaller individual pieces of code? How do we make sure they are operating properly? And how do you do it when those small pieces of code are interacting with network services, like external API calls? One answer for this is mocking these external requests and in this session we will find out how can we use Python's mock library to unit test a function using boto3 to make AWS API calls.<br/>Also, we will see how these unit tests can be automated by integrating them in a pipeline.</p> <p>• What to bring<br/>An appetite for learning!</p> <p>• Important to know<br/>We'll have drinks and pizza, sponsored by SumoLogic</p>","how_to_find_us":"Go into the main entrance of the WTC building, take the escalators to the 20th floor in Tower E.
