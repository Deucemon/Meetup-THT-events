Applications running on Mesos, also called frameworks, can use Mesos' APIs to schedule processes or containers across the cluster and implement features such as failover and autoscaling. During the development of the Elastic stack on Mesos (Elasticsearch, Logstash and Kibana) we found that the Mesos and Docker community is missing to locally develop and tests these Mesos frameworks. We decided to create our own tool for experimenting and testing Mesos called minimesos. It is available at <a href=\"http://www.minimesos.org/\"><a href=\"http://www.minimesos.org\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.minimesos.org</a></a></p> <p>Minimesos is an experimentation and testing tool that has a cli and a Java API which can be used from a JUnit test. You can start a Dockerized Mesos cluster, install Marathon apps and view the cluster state. Minimesos works on Linux with Docker and Docker on Mac has also been supported recently. For easy experimentation we support Mesos DNS so applications are resolvable on the .mm domain.In this talk I will introduce minimesos, it's features, design and implementation and what is on the horizon. After the talk there is time for some hands-on experimentation to deploy your application of choice on minimesos, ask questions and give suggestions and feedback on minimesos. </p> <p><b>For  hands-on experimentation please install the prerequisites.</b></p> <p>Foods and drinks powered by: </p> <p><img src=\"https://a248.e.akamai.net/secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/1/4/6/600_446952614.jpeg\" /></p>","event_url":"https://www.meetup.com/dev-070/events/238087546/","yes_rsvp_count":9,"name":"Intro into Minimesos with hands-on","id":"238087546","time":1491840000000,"updated":1491852553000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1398870328000,"name":"/dev/070","group_lon":4.28000020980835,"id":14194182,"urlname":"dev-070","group_lat":52.08000183105469,"who":"DevPro's"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":7200000,"venue":{"country":"nl","localized_country_name":"Netherlands","city":"Leidschendam","address_1":"Overgoo 11","name":"NCIM","lon":4.39449,"id":19846202,"lat":52.076591,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1492164049000,"rating":{"count":2,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>Program:</b></p> <p><b>18:00 Doors open - diner &amp; drinks</b></p> <p><b>19:00 Session begins!</b></p> <p><b>21:00 Official end</b></p> <p><img src=\"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/1/6/7/600_460400839.jpeg\" /></p> <p><b>Innovate with Cognitive IoT</b></p> <p>The impact of the Internet of Things on the way we run our businesses is unprecedented. Business models will change drastically, the IoT is unlocking competitive possibilities we could not imagine before. From refrigerators to cars, from buildings to machines, from water management systems to medical equipment, from elevators to our shoes, everything has sensors, everything is connected and is generating huge amounts of data. And we can use that data. Data is the new gold.Sensor data can help us to innovate, can help us to re-invent our businesses. But how? And why? Do we have a choice? And if we want to use the sensor data to innovate what do we need? Is it hard to connect devices? </p> <p>IBM is helping companies on this journey. The amounts of data already is beyond imagination, and lots of these data is unstructured and not easy to access. Traditional analysis methodologies and techniques are often no longer usable. Watson, the IBM cognitive computing system, will help us to unlock this data and turn it into information we can use in our advantage. </p> <p>In this meeting Sonja Mols and Arjen van de Wetering from IBM will tell you more about Cognitive IoT, and demonstrate how easy it already is to use this technology.</p>","event_url":"https://www.meetup.com/dev-070/events/239207892/","yes_rsvp_count":23,"name":"Innovate with Cognitive IoT","id":"239207892","time":1495468800000,"updated":1495531252000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1398870328000,"name":"/dev/070","group_lon":4.28000020980835,"id":14194182,"urlname":"dev-070","group_lat":52.08000183105469,"who":"DevPro's"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":7200000,"venue":{"country":"nl","localized_country_name":"Netherlands","city":"Leidschendam","address_1":"Overgoo 11","name":"NCIM","lon":4.39449,"id":19846202,"lat":52.076591,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":55,"headcount":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1492164115000,"rating":{"count":5,"average":4.800000190734863},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Program:</p> <p>18:00 Doors open - dinner &amp; drinks</p> <p>19:00 Session begins!</p> <p>21:00 Official end, have a chat/drink</p> <p>Speaker: Professor Jurgen Vinju (<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jurgenvinju/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/jurgenvinju/</a>)</p> <p>We know that most of a software engineers' time is spent answering questions about existing software, because even simple questions can be hard or costly to answer. Most of the time, the sheer volume of the source code makes it impossible to fully read and understand the code manually in order to answer such a question. An example question, let's say during a debugging session is: \"could it be a bug in one of our hashcode() or equals() implementations?\". A simple yes answer would solve the bug, a no answer would allow us to move on and form another hypothesis, but getting this simple answer requires a big code reading investment or an investment in writing a lot of new test code.</p> <p>In this talk we explore the ins and outs of treating the software itself as data, with an associated query and analysis technique to automated (partly) the information retrieval part of answering software questions. We introduce the ideas and concepts and a concrete tool to quickly build your own code analysis tools. The presentation ends with a hands-on example for finding violations of the hashcode()/equals() contract in Java code.</p> <p>Food &amp; Drinks powerd by:</p> <p><img src=\"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/d/9/3/600_461036723.jpeg\" /></p>","event_url":"https://www.meetup.com/dev-070/events/239207897/","yes_rsvp_count":13,"duration":10800000,"name":"What if… [y]our code were data?","id":"239207897","time":1496246400000,"updated":1496326333000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1398870328000,"name":"/dev/070","group_lon":4.28000020980835,"id":14194182,"urlname":"dev-070","group_lat":52.08000183105469,"who":"DevPro's"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":7200000,"venue":{"country":"nl","localized_country_name":"Netherlands","city":"Leidschendam","address_1":"Overgoo 11","name":"NCIM","lon":4.39449,"id":19846202,"lat":52.076591,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":15,"headcount":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1495775277000,"rating":{"count":8,"average":4.619999885559082},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b><br/></b></p> <p><img src=\"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/6/1/e/600_462330238.jpeg\" /></p> <p><b>Program</b>:</p> <p>18:00 Doors open - dinner &amp; drinks</p> <p>18:30 Workshop begins</p> <p>21:00 Official end, have a chat/drink</p> <p><b>Speaker</b>: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/rvanrijn/\">Robert van Rijn</a></p> <p><b>Requirements</b>: Get this repo: <a href=\"https://github.com/rvanrijn/workshop-apache-kafka-connect\">workshop</a> and follow the steps in the README.md then you will have the dependencies.</p> <p>In this workshop we will work with Apache Kafka Connect.</p> <p><a href=\"http://docs.confluent.io/current/connect/intro.html\">Kafka Connect</a> is a framework included in <a href=\"https://www.confluent.io/blog/stream-data-platform-1/\">Apache Kafka</a> that integrates Kafka with other systems.
