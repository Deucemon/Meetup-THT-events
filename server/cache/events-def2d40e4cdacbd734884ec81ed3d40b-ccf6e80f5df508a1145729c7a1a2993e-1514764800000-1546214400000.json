Peter Siebel interviews 15 of the top programmers of our time in his book, Coders at Work: Reflections on the Craft of Programming (<a href=\"http://www.codersatwork.com/\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.codersatwork.com/</a>). They provide insight into how they think, their views on the craft of software development and more. For this event we'll keep it simple and focus on the third and fourth interviews:</p> <p>1) Douglas Crockford - A senior JavaScript Architect at Yahoo!, Douglas Crockford has been a<br/>programmer since the early ’70s when he took a Fortran course in college after<br/>being unable to get studio time for his major in television broadcasting. Over the<br/>course of his career, he has combined computers with media in various ways at<br/>places like Atari, Lucasfilm, Electric Communities, and now Yahoo! 2) Brendan Eich - Creator of JavaScript, Brendan Eich is now CTO of the<br/>Mozilla Corporation, the subsidiary of the Mozilla Foundation responsible for<br/>continuing development of the Firefox browser. The book is available anywhere you can buy software books online, however feel free to take a peek at the content (<a href=\"http://one-shore.com/aaron/books/coders-at-work.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">http://one-shore.com/aaron/books/coders-at-work.pdf</a>) before deciding whether to dive in.</p> <p>Please read the specified two interviews in advance of the event so that we can discuss what we read together. They comprise fewer than 90 pages of light reading, but will be critical for participation. The rest of the book is also interesting, so feel free to read more!</p> <p>The location is Cafe Dudok, in the central area of Den Haag.

Want an impression? Check 2016. or 2017.bordersessions.org</p> <p>&amp;gt; We've pre-selected a number of people resulting in a list of 14 lab themes*. Check the themes below before registering for the meetup please. We can host only a limited number of extra people, so be quick!</p> <p>**So what is a lab?**<br/>A lab is a one- or two-day event where people gather around a specific theme or topic. A lab can be serie of inspiring talks, insightful debates and thoughtful discussions, *but* more often a lab is more: it produces tangible results or a project that continues beyond the festival. We are looking for ambitious, passionate people with interest, expertise, skills, or network related with the labs' themes. We now have confirmations for the following 14 labs:<br/>+ Bugs for Food - exploring insects and bugs as a viable food source in Western cuisine<br/>+ Artificial Intelligence for Art/Creatives - with KABK<br/>+ Blockchain for Good - building applications and discussing societal implications of blockchain technology<br/>+ Energy Labs - what's left to explore in the energy domain?<br/>+ Zero Waste Household - Designing a really smart home (one that deals with a real problem)<br/>+ Tech Nature - Intersecting nature and tech focused on autonomous eco-systems and embedded systems to create different interactions with nature<br/>+ Lab Moerwijk - redesign what's next for Moerwijk<br/>+ Biohacking - redesigning nature, redefining humans<br/>+ Rules of Law and Rules of Technology - with the World Justice Project<br/>+ Food &amp; City - how cities will feed themselves<br/>+ GovLab - service design for the government<br/>+ DataCommons - reclaiming your data... how?<br/>+ Biodiversity &amp; Tech - technology to save ecosystems<br/>+ AI in public space - what does the tech offer for better, more social, safer public spaces?</p> <p>We approach this through co-creation. We facilitate labs in different ways, basically with location and conference logistics (ticketing, potential sponsors and partners, the 10.000+ Border Sessions network), but we will also participate in the organisation of labs substantially, by providing speakers, moderators, and ideas.</p> <p>Define your lab's mission on February 8!</p> <p>*Your preferred lab theme not there? No problem: contact thieme@borderlabs.org to submit your lab and we'll let you know if it fits the overall Border Sessions mission.</p> <p>• What to bring<br/>Good ideas, two bananas, pyjamas, artificial intelligence.</p> <p>• Important to know<br/>Program will be sent by email, let us know if you come by registering for the event!</p>","how_to_find_us":"next to CS","event_url":"https://www.meetup.com/Border-Labs/events/246679074/","yes_rsvp_count":34,"duration":7200000,"name":"Border Sessions 2018: Co-create your next Border Lab","id":"246679074","photo_url":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/e/d/8/global_467488376.jpeg","time":1518098400000,"updated":1518110278000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1472044990000,"name":"Border Labs","group_lon":4.28000020980835,"id":20348833,"urlname":"Border-Labs","group_lat":52.08000183105469,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":3600000,"venue":{"country":"nl","localized_country_name":"Netherlands","city":"Den Haag","address_1":"Juliana van Stolberglaan 4-10","name":"The Hague Tech","lon":4.330667,"id":25441649,"lat":52.08168,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1517047685000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>• What we'll do</p> <p>Blockbar (previously 'Blockchain Lab Den Haag') is a fysical space where you can work on blockchain projects, develop ideas &amp; get to know other people in the scene.</p> <p>Be welcome to join at the new Lab at The Hague Tech (we started last week).

Hij heeft een tool ontwikkeld om softwarekwaliteit te meten en werkt nu aan een analyse die architectuur in een implementatie zichtbaar maakt. Jeroen heeft aan de basis gestaan van de ontwikkeling van enkele vooraanstaande platforms.</p> <p>In deze sessie verkennen we de raakvlakken tussen kwaliteit van broncode en security. Kwaliteit van broncode wordt doorgaans afgebakend onder de noemer onderhoudbaarheid van de ISO 25010 beschrijving van software kwaliteit. Onderhoudbaarheid is vrij goed te meten. Een globaal beeld geeft al veel inzicht. Security assessments van maatwerk software vergen een andere aanpak, omdat elk lek, elke kwetsbaarheid er één te veel is. Bovendien hangt veel af van de infrastructuur en gehanteerde procedures. Toch is er op een aantal punten een belangrijke overlap tussen onderhoudbaarheid en security.

Data delen biedt veel kansen en nieuwe mogelijkheden. Maar hoe organiseer je dat je zelf zeggenschap houdt over het delen van je data? Op 7 maart organiseren Maakbaar en DataCommons samen een meetup over technische oplossingen om data te delen op jouw voorwaarden. Het doel van de vereniging DataCommons is om te komen tot een open architectuur waarmee verschillende niveaus van data-controle kunnen worden geïmplementeerd. Deze architectuur kan misschien met behulp van blockchain-achtige technologieën ‘hard’ worden afgedwongen, maar kan ook geïmplementeerd worden in een ‘zachter’ permissie-systeem, gebaseerd op het vertrouwen in de aanbieder van de digitale dienst. In deze meetup onderzoeken we architecturen en oplossingsrichtingen. Ook gaan we op zoek naar pilots waarin we de architectuur in de praktijk kunnen uittesten. Vereniging DataCommons streeft naar een infrastructuur waarin jij bepaalt onder welke voorwaarden jij je data deelt. Denk en doe je mee?

But how about testing smaller individual pieces of code? How do we make sure they are operating properly? And how do you do it when those small pieces of code are interacting with network services, like external API calls? One answer for this is mocking these external requests and in this session we will find out how can we use Python's mock library to unit test a function using boto3 to make AWS API calls.<br/>Also, we will see how these unit tests can be automated by integrating them in a pipeline.</p> <p>• What to bring<br/>An appetite for learning!</p> <p>• Important to know<br/>We'll have drinks and pizza, sponsored by SumoLogic</p>","how_to_find_us":"Go into the main entrance of the WTC building, take the escalators to the 20th floor in Tower E.

Inmiddels werken we aan applicaties om de HoloLens te kunnen toepassen voor en tijdens complexe operaties. Het interactief analyseren van het menselijk lichaam, gebaseerd op MRI-, PAT- en CT-scans, blijkt een enorme positieve impact te hebben op de effectiviteit van de operatie en het verlagen van de tijd dat een patiënt op de operatietafel ligt. Tevens zijn kostenverlagingen mogelijk door toepassing van de HoloLens.</p> <p>In deze presentatie tonen we de stand van zaken van een project dat Info Support uitvoert met het BTI (Brain Technology Institute) van het UMC (Utrecht Medisch Centrum). Hiermee beogen we de toepassing van de HoloLens voor 3D neuronavigatie, als alternatief voor bestaande doch dure 2D apparatuur.</p> <p>Level:[masked] – Beginner/Intermediate<br/>Type: Functioneel<br/>Spreker: Tom Mensink</p> <p>21u00 – 21u30 - Borrel</p> <p>Meer informatie op de website van de MIxUG.<br/><a href=\"https://www.mixug.com/mixug-evenement-maart-2018/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.mixug.com/mixug-evenement-maart-2018/</a></p>","event_url":"https://www.meetup.com/Mixed-Reality-User-Group/events/247416013/","yes_rsvp_count":26,"duration":10800000,"name":"Mixed Reality User Group Evenement - Maart 2018","id":"247416013","photo_url":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/e/3/0/global_468656880.jpeg","time":1521653400000,"updated":1521788452000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1515136295000,"name":"Mixed Reality User Group","group_lon":4.360000133514404,"id":27056440,"urlname":"Mixed-Reality-User-Group","group_lat":52.04999923706055,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":3600000,"venue":{"country":"nl","localized_country_name":"Netherlands","city":"'s-Gravenhage","address_1":"Den Haag","name":"Den Haag","lon":4.313685,"id":920683,"lat":52.078289,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1520619504000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>• What we'll do<br/>[masked] Ontvangst<br/>[masked] Inleiding<br/>[masked] Presentatie Nieuwe Algemene Verordening Gegevensbescherming of GDPR<br/>[masked] Pauze<br/>[masked] Vragen &amp; Discussie naar aanleiding van praktijkvoorbeelden<br/>[masked] Afsluiting &amp; Netwerken</p> <p>• What to bring<br/>Vragen en ervaringen met betrekking tot de nieuwe AVG/GDPR</p> <p>• Important to know<br/>GDPR introductie, Inleiding AVG, Privacy in je bedrijf, Privacy en jouw werkzaamheden</p>","event_url":"https://www.meetup.com/Privacy-Data-Information-Security-Meetup/events/248577320/","yes_rsvp_count":1,"duration":9000000,"name":"De Nieuwe AVG: Algemene Verordening Gegevensbescherming/GDPR en jij ","id":"248577320","photo_url":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/9/e/c/global_469103020.jpeg","time":1521727200000,"updated":1521743718000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1520609070000,"name":"Privacy Data & Information Security Meetup","group_lon":4.28000020980835,"id":27775424,"urlname":"Privacy-Data-Information-Security-Meetup","group_lat":52.08000183105469,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":3600000,"venue":{"country":"nl","localized_country_name":"Netherlands","city":"Den Haag","address_1":"Westhovenplein 46","name":"Made in Moerwijk","lon":4.295532,"id":25771730,"lat":52.04621,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1521273804000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Donderdag 22 maart organiseren we de volgende Replastic workshop over zelf te maken machines voor hergebruik van plastic.

Hoe kunnen we dit rijmen: in maatschappelijke zin de opmars van bitcoin (in steeds meer landen adoptie, steeds meer decentrale architecturen en de jeugd is niet van het speculeren en uitproberen te houden) en in technische zin het Lightning Network, atomic swaps en interoperabiliteit. De koers zou juist nu door het dak kunnen vliegen. Waarom niet. Hoe kan dat.</p> <p>Waar staat Blockchain nu? Wat deed en doet de hype rondom cryptocurrencies en zijn use-cases van blockchain nu echt zinnig?! Antwoord op de laatste vraag is een volmondig 'ja'. Kom naar de meetup voor de andere antwoorden en hoe je jezelf in de wereld kunt verrijken ... met kennis!</p> <p>=====================</p> <p>Talk 2:<br/>Bitcoin staat op eenzame hoogte op het vlak van bewezen veiligheid en robuustheid. Betekent dit dat de rol van andere blockchains experimenteel en voorlopig beperkt bruikbaar is?</p> <p>Bart van Maarseveen licht aan de hand van een sprekend voorbeeld uit hoe blockchains complementair met elkaar kunnen werken waardoor een krachtig ecosysteem duidelijk wordt en zich voor de luisteraars een nieuwe toepassing voor bitcoin openbaart. Een toepassing met een ongekende potentie.</p> <p>Bio<br/>===<br/>Bart van Maarseveen (@bvanmaarseveen) heeft een verleden met open source en internet technologie dat terug gaat tot begin jaren 90. Vanuit die wereld waren de cryptografie en de honger naar digitaal geld nooit ver weg. Door alle digitaal geld mislukkingen uit het verleden eerst nog sceptisch, maar in 2016 kwam het besef dat het dit keer allemaal klopte. Vanaf dat jaar heeft Bart besloten zich volledig te richten op de kansen en communities binnen deze nieuwe wereld met de open source gedachte als moreel kompas.</p> <p>Bart adviseert organisaties over (blockchains) innovatie en organiseert open teams ter realisatie. Daarnaast is hij de initiator van Blockrock, een podcast-serie over de nederlandse blockchain mensen, projecten &amp; organisaties en is hij betrokken bij de organisatie van open blockchain labs in Den Haag en Amsterdam.<br/>===</p> <p>Bio<br/>===<br/>Henk van Cann (@henkvancann) heeft zich sinds 2013 in blockchain technologie verdiept. Sinds 2016 is hij volledig gefocust op blockchain toepassingen voor vraagstukken waar e-identity een rol speelt (je digitale ‘ik’). Hij leerde “hard” van de bitcoin. Van Cann spreekt met passie over het 'wat', het 'hoe', maar vooral het 'waarom' van de toevallige uitvinding blockchain. Henk vertelt op een inzichtelijke manier hoe blockchains werken en wat het voor je kan betekenen. En ook: hoe kun je in deze nieuwe wereld zelf het kaf van het koren in berichtgeving en meningen leert scheiden. In interactieve presentaties geeft Van Cann voorbeelden van andere toepassingen dan alleen geld. Steeds hopend dat er een paar vonkjes vrij komen of vlammetjes gaan branden over de mogelijkheden van deze technologie binnen het eigen werk en privé bij aanwezigen.</p> <p>In het verleden was Henk ondernemer in GIS, bouwde een bedrijf van vijfentwintig mensen op de loonlijst. Later bouwde hij een bedrijf op in open source CMS systemen dat enkel werkte met een team van zelfstandige kleine bedrijven. He verkocht de twee bedrijven achtereenvolgens in 1999 en 2016.</p>","event_url":"https://www.meetup.com/dev-070/events/249564964/","yes_rsvp_count":20,"duration":10800000,"name":"Waar staat Blockchain nu?...","id":"249564964","photo_url":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/2/7/4/global_470261588.jpeg","time":1524499200000,"updated":1524645920000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1398870328000,"name":"/dev/070","group_lon":4.28000020980835,"id":14194182,"urlname":"dev-070","group_lat":52.08000183105469,"who":"DevPro's"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":7200000,"venue":{"country":"nl","localized_country_name":"Netherlands","city":"Den Haag","address_1":"Juliana van Stolberglaan 4-10","name":"The Hague Tech","lon":4.330667,"id":25441649,"lat":52.08168,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1522194559000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>WARNING: THIS MEETUP IS CANCELED</p> <p>We will talk about different ICOs, in a structured format and will facilitate an open discussion about the merits of each project, allowing you to identify and distinguish between good and bad projects, how to make sure you aren't contributing to scams, and hear a varied selection of opinions from the other participants.</p> <p>Our team will be there to moderate and share their insights from their experience in this space.

The law was developed because the EU wishes to create a uniform, secure, European digital environment.

Maar waarom zoveel kostbare tijd besteden, zonder te weten of je de juiste kant op gaat? Fail fast, learn faster. Met een design sprint, beperk je maanden werk tot slechts 5 dagen.</p> <p>Binnen één week ga je van niets naar volledig nieuw concept gevalideerd met gebruikers.</p> <p>De design sprint, ontwikkeld door Google Ventures, is dé manier om nieuwe concepten te ontwikkelen in een markt die constant in beweging is. Het geeft je de kant om risico’s te nemen en je meest gedurfde ideeën direct te testen met jouw gebruikers.</p> <p>Wat ga je leren?<br/>Tijdens deze crash course leer je over het volledige sprint proces waarmee we al meer dan 30 innovatieve concepten ontwikkelden samen met klanten als SNS Bank, FOX-IT, International Baccalaureate, Proagrica, Pronexus en Reed Business.</p> <p>Wij geloven in een hands-on aanpak als de beste manier om te leren. Je gaat dus vooral zelf aan de slag. We oefenen in kleine groepjes, gebruiken voorbeelden uit de praktijk en hebben veel ruimte voor jouw vragen.</p> <p>&amp;gt; Stap voor stap uitleg van het sprint proces<br/>&amp;gt; Zelf aan de slag met de meest belangrijke oefeningen<br/>&amp;gt; Hoe maak je snel beslissingen, zonder discussies</p> <p>Tips en tricks uit de praktijk: wat hadden wij graag willen weten voor onze eerste sprint</p> <p>De missende hoofdstukken uit het boek: wat komt er vóór en na de design sprint?</p> <p>Aan het eind van de dag weet je wanneer, hoe en waarom je een Design Sprint in zou zetten.</p> <p>Esther Wieringa en Matthijs Zwinderman faciliteerden samen al meer dan 30 design sprints. Zij kunnen tijdens de crash course al jullie vragen over design sprints beantwoorden en delen maar al te graag al hun ervaringen uit de praktijk.</p> <p>Voor wie?<br/>Deze workshop is niet alleen voor designers! Iedereen die werkt binnen product ontwikkeling of innovatie kan aan de slag met deze methode. Deze workshop is perfect voor: Product owners / Start-up founders / Designers / Team-leads / Product managers / Innovatie-managers;</p> <p>Iedereen die geïnteresseerd is in het sneller ontwikkelen van innovatieve producten.</p> <p>Schrijf je in<br/>Binnenkort zelf aan de slag met design sprints?

Het onderwerp dit keer is “Hoe pas je “Scaling Scrum” toe in een organisatie.”. Wanneer een organisatie begint met Agile werken en Scrum dan zijn dit over het algemeen eerst losse teams. Deze teams zijn meestal gebaseerd op de huidige organisatiestructuur, je komt dan teams tegen die “.Net en SQL” doen, of “Cobol”, of BI. Maar wat als er een moment komt dat je meerdere teams wilt laten werken aan één oplossing? Hoe doe je dit het beste? Ga je de bestaande teams verdubbelen? Of ga je een logische indeling kiezen?</p> <p>Tijdens de Scrum Round Table willen we graag met de deelnemers hierover in discussie gaan. Zoals gebruikelijk doen we dit aan de hand van een klein stukje achtergrond en een game gevolgd door discussie. We sluiten af met een borrel.</p> <p>Spreekt het onderwerp je aan? Vind je het leuk om actief mee te doen en kennis en ervaring in te brengen?

Millions of artificial agents are joining the interaction. We can sit and discuss threats and uncertainties for hours, and we should. But not in this lab. At least not after the thoughtful introductions by our keynote speakers who will join us in this lab.</p> <p>This is a straightforward day for AI practitioners to create and test concepts that improve public spaces around us. How can we use AI to improve our physical surroundings? How do we use it in our public lives? Which autonomous agents should join the interaction? Talking flower beds? Self-cleaning city air? Propagating squares for improved civic debate?</p> <p>AI lovers and friends of a healthy public space, join this lab. Bots are welcome too!</p> <p>In this lab, we will collaborate in hands-on experiments and do provocative research: we design a prototype for an AI agent that acts in public spaces and investigate how citizens react to this.

We zullen deze avond kennismaken met de makers van HyperDev die ons alles gaan vertellen over dit nieuwe CI/CD platform dat al bij meerdere Eonics projecten met succes wordt ingezet.</p> <p>HyperDev is gebouwd dóór en vóór developers &amp; testers. Het platform biedt alles wat je nodig hebt voor moderne softwareontwikkeling volgens de DevOps werkwijze. Je kunt het zien als een kant en klare ontwikkelstraat die je volledig naar eigen wens kunt inrichten en aanpassen, zonder kostbare tijd te verspillen aan beheer en infrastructuur. HyperDev is gebouwd op Docker Swarm. Het HyperDev dashboard en de bijbehorende API ontsluiten alle functionaliteiten voor de ontwikkelaars. Daarnaast is het heel eenvoudig om met een druk op de knop (of een simpele API call) volledige omgevingen te starten en te stoppen. Op deze manier kunnen ook testers en andere stakeholders eenvoudig gebruikmaken van de voordelen van HyperDev. Omdat alles binnen HyperDev dockerized en geversioneerd is, kunnen er op ieder moment een willekeurig aantal gescheiden omgevingen en applicaties worden gestart, zonder dat deze elkaar beïnvloeden zoals in een klassieke ontwikkel- of testomgeving vaak het geval is.</p> <p>Meer informatie:</p> <p>- <a href=\"http://hyperdev.io\" class=\"linkified\">http://hyperdev.io</a><br/>- <a href=\"https://eonics.nl/inbox/open-hack-night-pt-11-ci-cd-met-hyperdev\" class=\"linkified\">https://eonics.nl/inbox/open-hack-night-pt-11-ci-cd-met-hyperdev</a></p>","event_url":"https://www.meetup.com/HyperDev-Meetup/events/251469064/","yes_rsvp_count":8,"duration":12600000,"name":"HyperDev: Cloud based docker platform","id":"251469064","time":1529508600000,"updated":1529565953000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1528274681000,"name":"HyperDev Meetup","group_lon":4.28000020980835,"id":28722953,"urlname":"HyperDev-Meetup","group_lat":52.08000183105469,"who":"Leden"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":7200000,"venue":{"country":"nl","localized_country_name":"Netherlands","city":"The Hague","address_1":"Prinses Beatrixlaan 582","address_2":"20th floor","name":"OlinData Office WTC","lon":4.336472,"id":25744162,"lat":52.078953,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":40,"headcount":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1526293195000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>• What we'll do<br/>At our AWS Meetup The Hague we'll have two interesting talks and some beer and pizza.</p> <p>The first talk:<br/>Speaker:<br/>Marcello Evangelista (OlinData)</p> <p>Title:<br/>Cloud Security 101: The new paradigms of having your data floating above our heads.</p> <p>Summary:<br/>In this introductory talk, we will go through the technical standpoints and also how the cloud affects the old security model philosophically.

How will artificial intelligence influence the legal and judicial landscape, in an era where machines can analyse forensic evidence, comprehend legal documents, and even generate verdicts? What questions of ethics are raised when autonomous machines can give diagnoses, conduct medical tests, and perform surgeries? How much autonomy do we give intelligent machines, and who do we blame when they make mistakes?</p> <p>As a specific example, we will see how AI and technology, in general, shape the legal industry and what opportunities arise for legal corporations and professionals interested in the legal industry.</p> <p>Come to The Hague Tech on the 16th of July, where our two speakers will bring you abreast of the latest technological advancements and opportunities in the legal field, address your questions, and perhaps raise some more questions for you to think about!</p> <p>The speakers:<br/>Georgios Stathis (1995) is a Ph.D. Candidate on Computational Law and Data Science and Research Assistant at the Introduction of the Data Protection Reform to the Judicial System (INFORM) project of eLaw Center at Leiden University.<br/>He studied Global Law (LL.B.) at Tilburg University (2016) and International and European Trade and Investment Law (LL.M.) at the University of Amsterdam (UvA) (2017).<br/>For more information: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/georgios-stathis-75586010b/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/georgios-stathis-75586010b/</a></p> <p>Olya (Olga) Kudina is a PhD candidate at the Philosophy Department of the University of Twente.

He was a guest attendee at AI for Good Global Summit at the United Nations. Wilder now works at Quby, where he and his colleagues focus on developing models to give insight on energy and gas efficiency for the Toon Smart Thermostat.</p> <p>During my journey on the way to become a Machine Learning Engineer after 20 years working with traditional Software Development, I came up with an idea to reduce the impact caused by the Dying Rectified Linear Unit (a.k.a Dying ReLU) issue on Neural Networks and improve accuracy, The new Rectified Linear Unit with Sinusoidal Curve (a.k.a. SineReLU) does not flattens out negative weights to zero, but instead, it combines them with an extra function and an extra hyper-parameter, then enabling differentiability at any point of the function.</p> <p>This approach is also superior to the Leaky-ReLU implementation due to the oscillations that it adds to negative weights. So, instead of linearly moving down the bottom-left quadrant based on the Leaky-ReLU alpha parameter, it uses the difference between the sine and cosine functions to create a wave. The amplitude of this wave depends on the hyper-parameter ε.</p> <p>With this approach, problems like vanishing or exploring gradients, introduced by sigmoid and tanh functions, and the dying ReLU, are mitigated.</p> <p>This talk will cover the Path; the Inspiration; and the Accomplishments after one hard year of studies.</p>","event_url":"https://www.meetup.com/dev-070/events/251673418/","yes_rsvp_count":19,"duration":10800000,"name":"An evening about Machine Learning","id":"251673418","time":1532361600000,"updated":1532380292000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1398870328000,"name":"/dev/070","group_lon":4.28000020980835,"id":14194182,"urlname":"dev-070","group_lat":52.08000183105469,"who":"DevPro's"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":7200000,"venue":{"country":"nl","localized_country_name":"Netherlands","city":"Den Haag","address_1":"Juliana van Stolberglaan 10","name":"The Hague Tech","lon":4.331146,"id":24963073,"lat":52.082062,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":16,"headcount":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1530811223000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Every Thursday afternoon we are hosting the Ai Lab - co-working sessions where you can come to work and discuss your Machine Learning / Deep Learning / Ai related projects or start something new with the other community members.

Veelal zijn dat uitgaande campagnes met veel push marketing. Al zijn er al flink wat merken bezig met inbound marketing. Met inbound- of content marketing wordt meer gekeken naar de echte informatie behoefte van klanten. Zo is het mogelijk om klanten voor je product of dienst te enthousiasmeren op een moment dat de klant de meeste behoefte heeft aan je product of dienst. En dat zonder ‘koop mij’ te roepen. De verkoop verloopt zo veel natuurlijker.</p> <p>Vaak ontbreekt nu nog de samenhang bij content marketing; wat doen we wel en wat doen we niet? Welke thema’s kiezen we? En hoe zorgen we voor een goed geïntegreerde content marketing flow? Dat gaat veel verder dan bijvoorbeeld het social media beleid van een merk.</p> <p>Roeland de Bruin heeft als interim manager de marketing- en communicatie afdelingen geleid van onder andere Triodos Bank, Wereld Natuurfonds, Cito, Electrabel en Eneco. In veel van die rollen heeft hij content marketing en inbound marketing een meer prominente rol gegeven. Hij zal vertellen over zijn ervaringen op dat gebied. Daarbij laat hij zien hoe je met de principes van de design sprint een samenhangend en effectief content marketing beleid kunt opzetten.</p> <p>Naast de presentatie van Roeland de Bruin gaan we ook hands-on aan de slag en kijken we hoe we zelf een content marketing plan op kunnen zetten.</p> <p>Programma<br/>17:00 inloop, pizza en bier<br/>17:30 presentatie van Roeland de Bruin over een Content Design Sprint<br/>18:00 Cool Content Design Sprint oefenen in teams<br/>19:00 borrel</p> <p>Met behulp van de principes van design sprints kun je een goed uitgangspunt opzetten.</p>","how_to_find_us":"We zitten in de ronde toren bij het oude Haagse vliegveld Ypenburg ✈️ ","event_url":"https://www.meetup.com/Den-Haag-Agile-UX/events/252667525/","yes_rsvp_count":19,"duration":7200000,"name":"Hoe kun je technieken uit de design sprint toepassen op jouw content marketing?","id":"252667525","photo_url":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/b/1/7/global_472815127.jpeg","time":1535641200000,"updated":1535652541000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1493382643000,"name":"Den Haag Agile UX","group_lon":4.28000020980835,"id":23468679,"urlname":"Den-Haag-Agile-UX","group_lat":52.08000183105469,"who":"Leden"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":7200000,"venue":{"country":"nl","localized_country_name":"Netherlands","city":"Den Haag","address_1":"Zwedenburg 99","name":"FabLab Mariahoeve","lon":4.360843,"id":25917600,"lat":52.09194,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":15,"headcount":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1534852458000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Free walk-in for anyone interested.

Maar Kanban is meer dan het afstrepen van lijstjes of user stories naar “Done” zetten. Het zorgt ook vanuit het proces al voor continue verbetering. Tijdens de Scrum Round Table willen we graag met de deelnemers hierover in discussie gaan. Zoals gebruikelijk doen we dit aan de hand van een klein stukje achtergrond, een game gevolgd door discussie en afgesloten met een borrel. Spreekt het onderwerp je aan?

Deze tools maken hoge kwaliteit software-ontwikkeling een stuk eenvoudiger voor ontwikkelaars en andere betrokkenen. In deze Open Hack Night zullen we inzoomen op een specifieke onderdeel van dit ontwikkel-proces; browser-based testen met behulp van het TestX framework in een Dockerized omgeving (ook de geautomatiseerde testen draaien in een container). Dit test-framework is gebaseerd op Protractor en integreert uitstekend met Docker en HyperDev. Dit is niet verwonderlijk aangezien het ontwikkeld wordt door HyperDev mede-oprichter Gantcho Kojuharov, die ook aanwezig zal zijn.</p> <p>Deze Open Hack Night wordt geleid door Vince van Oosten. Vince heeft als DevOps expert bij Eonics al veel met TestX gewerkt, waarbij hij het framework zelfs heeft toegepast buiten het test-domein. Inmiddels heeft hij dan ook diverse patches aangedragen die het framework verder hebben verbeterd en uitgebreid. Na de inleidende presentatie, natuurlijk gevolgd door de traditionele pizza-pauze, gaan we zelf de mouwen opstropen en onder begeleiding kennismaken met de voordelen van deze werkwijze.

Currently, the biggest known DDoS to date peaked at 1.7 Tb/s. The rise of the so-called IoT botnets means that services are now vulnerable to a massive army sizeable to originate legitimate traffic (no spoofed packets).<br/>In this talk, we will use the DNS system as case study and present the research we have been carrying out over the last years within the SAND project (<a href=\"http://www.sand-project.nl/\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.sand-project.nl/</a>) to better engineer DNS in the face of rising DDoS attacks, and we show how our recommendations were ultimately deployed at SIDN (.nl operator), as well as others. Even though our case study is DNS, participants can also use some of the recommendations in others services.<br/>Short bio: Giovane C. M. Moura is a Data Scientist with SIDN Labs (the research arm of SIDN) and a Research Guest at The Cyber Security at Delft University of Technology. His research focuses on Internet routing and engineering, as well as security. He holds a PhD from the University of Twente (2013).\"</p> <p>Faris Tangastani will talk about his personal take on starting with a React<br/>\"This topic will be about learning something new, specifically React.

Ik vergelijk het altijd met uitleggen hoe appeltaart smaakt: je kunt beter een hap nemen dan uren praten over de interactie tussen deeg, appels, kaneel, suiker.....</p> <p>Dat is allemaal leuk en aardig, maar niet praktisch als je een demo moet geven voor een groep mensen. Zo gauw je al meer dan een paar personen hebt, is het doorgeven van de HoloLens niet meer te doen. Zoals je wel weet, moet de HoloLens voor iedere gebruiker opnieuw ingesteld worden om de IPD goed te zetten. En wie dat doet nu eigenlijk nog?</p> <p>Gelukkig hebben we Mixed Reality Capture. Je kunt met een browser de gegenereerde hologrammen de beelden van de ingebouwde webcam mixen en delen op een scherm. Dat is een stap in de geode richting, maar niet goed genoeg.</p> <p>Microsoft heeft dat ook door, en heeft de Spectator View in het leven geroepen. Hiermee krijg je een veel betere ervaring dan via de MRC. Maar... dit is erg lastig in te regelen en om verreist veel kennis en ervaring (en dure apparatuur, zoals een extra HoloLens, een dure camera, capture cards enzovoorts).</p> <p>Het leek er lange tijd op dat dit problem niet op te lossen was.</p> <p>Totdat ineens het bericht verscheen dat er een lower-tech oplossing was die dicht in de buurt van de Spectator View oplossing komt. Niet helemaal, maar goed genoeg!</p> <p>In deze sessie neemt Dennis je mee door deze scenarios en laat je zien hoe je een demo geeft die mensen nog lang zal heugen.

How can we integrate our organisational and IT security efforts with our cloud? The Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) Cloud Controls Matrix (CCM) is specifically designed to provide fundamental security principles to guide cloud vendors and to assist cloud customers in assessing the overall security risk of services.

Patterns and tools are emerging, or re-emerging, that make security less of a pain in the development process while also making applications more secure.

Our first meetup will take place at Cleverbase, Maanweg 174 Den Haag, which is conveniently located close to NS station Voorburg.</p> <p>The agenda:</p> <p>18:00 start with food and drinks</p> <p>19:00 Willem Vermeer of Cleverbase - \"Typed actors - should I start using them?\". This talk was also accepted for Scala Exchange London in December 2018</p> <p>\"Typed actors are finally here and for all of you lovers of typesafe programming - just their name is enough to get you excited! But here you are, maintaining a large scala/akka codebase - should you immediately migrate all your actors to typed actors? What will be the benefits and will your code look shinier when you're done? How are you going to sell this internal refactoring to the boss? In this talk, you will discover attempts to step into the world of typed actors. What was the impact, what have you learned, what is still missing and what did you end up with. The talk is aimed for you if you are interested in akka development but have not made the move to typed actors yet but may be wondering what you could be missing.\"</p> <p>19:45 break</p> <p>20:00 Marcel Matthijs of Tradecloud - \"How we integrated Apache Kafka into the Tradecloud architecture\"</p> <p>\"Apache Kafka looks very attractive at first sight when you are building<br/>available and scalable applications using Akka and Scala. Looking at your<br/>requirements, when do you decide to use Kafka or rather not? How does a<br/>software architecture and infrastructure using Kafka and Akka look like?<br/>What are recommended Scala libraries for using Kafka?</p> <p>We will quickly explain what Kafka does, introduce use cases of Kakfa, explain the event-driven software architecture and clustered infrastructure used at Tradecloud. We will zoom in on the Alpakka reactive streams Kafka connector (<a href=\"https://github.com/akka/alpakka-kafka\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/akka/alpakka-kafka</a>) and our Kafka Akka wrapper (<a href=\"https://github.com/tradecloud/akka-kafka\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/tradecloud/akka-kafka</a>) which makes your Kafka life just a bit easier.\"</p> <p>20:45 drinks</p> <p>21:30 the end</p> <p>The building is being renovated - do not let the decrepit atmosphere of the entrance scare you off. Pass through the glass doors and take a left to the elevators and get out at the 14th floor then take a right and ring the doorbell. For security reasons we will hand out personalised name tags when you enter.</p> <p>If you plan to come by car: do NOT park in the garage underneath the main building - it closes at 7pm! Instead try to park across the Maanweg - after 17:00 parking is free in this municipal zone.</p>","event_url":"https://www.meetup.com/Haaglanden-scala/events/256031002/","yes_rsvp_count":19,"duration":12600000,"name":"Kick-off with presentations on Kafka and Akka Typed Actors","id":"256031002","photo_url":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/e/5/d/global_475964637.jpeg","time":1543338000000,"updated":1543353701000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1540935700000,"name":"Haaglanden.scala","group_lon":4.28000020980835,"id":30427792,"urlname":"Haaglanden-scala","group_lat":52.08000183105469,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":3600000,"venue":{"country":"nl","localized_country_name":"Netherlands","city":"Den Haag","address_1":"Juliana van Stolberglaan 10","name":"The Hague Tech","lon":4.331146,"id":24963073,"lat":52.082062,"repinned":true},"rsvp_limit":16,"headcount":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1541179679000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Every Thursday afternoon we are hosting the Ai Lab - co-working sessions where you can come to work and discuss your Machine Learning / Deep Learning / Ai related projects or start something new with the other community members.
