With a significant audience growth opportunity at hand, designers are poised to reinvigorate cannabis’ role, with a vision for more purposeful and enriching experiences. In this ideation session and interactive workshop, we’ll explore the role that enabling technology can play in creating more personalized cannabis offerings. Framed by provocations around cannabis, common user problems, and personalization insights, each group will envision concepts that extend cannabis offerings beyond traditional contexts, into memorable and meaningful experiences that add value to users’ lives.</p> <p><b>Participant profile</b><br/>Diverse group of people representing:<br/>– designers, strategists, product managers, user experience architects, technologists, etc.<br/>– a wide spread of nationalities<br/>– different experience levels (junior/beginner to senior/advanced)<br/>– mix of male/female<br/>– mix of industry expertise</p> <p><i>With Nicole Baccus</i></p> <p><b>For this workshop you need to register up front. </b></p>","event_url":"https://www.meetup.com/Border-Labs/events/240758545/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"Beyond the Plant: Cannabis 2.0","id":"240758545","time":1498723200000,"updated":1498735051000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1472044990000,"name":"Border Labs","group_lon":4.28000020980835,"id":20348833,"urlname":"Border-Labs","group_lat":52.08000183105469,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":7200000,"venue":{"country":"nl","localized_country_name":"Netherlands","city":"Den Haag 2511 BN","address_1":"Spui 187","name":"Theater Aan het Spui","lon":4.3172,"id":23483790,"lat":52.076191,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1497988028000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>The first 'real' AstroPlant prototype will be launched next week at Border Sessions (check out their amazing program at bordersessions.org).

It is based on the author’s 33 years of experience of robotics development in Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd., JAMSTEC, and Nagasaki University, and contains many examples of real-world robots from new underwater vehicles, ships, robotic fish and unmanned aviation robotics, to space robotics, and medical robotics. You’ll learn how to undertake your personal mission to create your own unmanned robot and imagine how future robotics in society look like.</p> <p><i>With Ikuo Yamamoto.'</i></p> <p><b>For this workshop you need to register up front. </b></p>","event_url":"https://www.meetup.com/Border-Labs/events/240758627/","yes_rsvp_count":2,"duration":7200000,"name":"How to Build Your Advanced Robotics for Marine","id":"240758627","time":1498741200000,"updated":1498749585000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1472044990000,"name":"Border Labs","group_lon":4.28000020980835,"id":20348833,"urlname":"Border-Labs","group_lat":52.08000183105469,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":7200000,"venue":{"country":"nl","localized_country_name":"Netherlands","city":"'s-Gravenhage","address_1":"Spui 191","name":"Filmhuis Den Haag","lon":4.317149,"id":1529851,"lat":52.076191,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1497367641000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><a href=\"https://www.bordersessions.org/session/autonomous-vehicles-good-evil/\">Please follow this link to register.</a></p> <p>Self-driving vehicles are here—and cars and trucks are just the beginning. Autonomous vehicles (AVs) will be in our homes, the skies, beneath the earth, in the seas, and in space. And like every major technology, they’ll be used for good and for bad. This workshop grounds you in the state of affairs and in the basic concepts that make AVs work. Together, we’ll explore new ideas for concepts and products in an AV-ified world — for your organizations’s good, or perhaps… more evil purposes. This workshop is aimed at anyone interested in the possibilities and doesn’t require any technical background. It is limited to 25 participants.</p> <p><i>With Tim van Deursen and Anton Vanhoucke</i></p> <p><b>For this workshop you need to register up front. </b></p> <p>&lt;a href=\"https://www.bordersessions.org/session/autonomous-vehicles-good-evil/#signup\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</p>","event_url":"https://www.meetup.com/Border-Labs/events/240758808/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"duration":6300000,"name":"Autonomous Vehicles for Good and Evil","id":"240758808","time":1498813200000,"updated":1498821887000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1472044990000,"name":"Border Labs","group_lon":4.28000020980835,"id":20348833,"urlname":"Border-Labs","group_lat":52.08000183105469,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":7200000,"venue":{"country":"nl","localized_country_name":"Netherlands","city":"'s-Gravenhage","address_1":"Spui 191","name":"Filmhuis Den Haag","lon":4.317149,"id":1529851,"lat":52.076191,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1497367422000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><a href=\"https://www.bordersessions.org/session/techsense/\">Please follow this link to register.</a></p> <p>In the field of wearable technology, or so-called 'e-textiles', the relationship between body, technology and environment takes center stage. How can technology help us to connect to our bodies and maximize our senses? During this workshop you will experience in a more intuitive way what e-textile or wearable technology could mean for you. In a playful way, through some movement exercises, we will explore your senses. We will experiment with physical contact to things and others around us, as participants will discover and explore an added layer of communication. Lastly, with a prepared suit embedded with electronics, the participants will interpret the sensation of movements and their connections with others by way of sound.</p> <p><i>With Anja Hertenberger</i></p> <p><b>For this workshop you need to register up front. </b></p>","event_url":"https://www.meetup.com/Border-Labs/events/240758720/","yes_rsvp_count":2,"duration":7200000,"name":"TechSense","id":"240758720","time":1498821300000,"updated":1498830125000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1472044990000,"name":"Border Labs","group_lon":4.28000020980835,"id":20348833,"urlname":"Border-Labs","group_lat":52.08000183105469,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":7200000,"venue":{"country":"nl","localized_country_name":"Netherlands","city":"Den Haag","address_1":"Juliana van Stolberglaan 4-10","name":"The Hague Tech","lon":4.330667,"id":25441649,"lat":52.08168,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":20,"headcount":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1505465185000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>This is going to be a focused, invite-only hackathon to finalise the current prototype and make it ready for testing.</p> <p>A prep doc is <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1shLhx2PkWhttHzzIVLfzXh6TvhcsyIzy10_bjyA5I9M/edit\">here</a>.</p> <p><img src=\"https://www.esa.int/var/esa/storage/images/esa_multimedia/images/2017/07/cosmic_farming/17048607-1-eng-GB/Cosmic_farming_node_full_image_2.jpg\" /></p>","event_url":"https://www.meetup.com/Border-Labs/events/243386333/","yes_rsvp_count":13,"duration":37800000,"name":"Finalisation hackathon AstroPlant v1.0 (or v4.0?)","id":"243386333","time":1506756600000,"updated":1506798102000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1472044990000,"name":"Border Labs","group_lon":4.28000020980835,"id":20348833,"urlname":"Border-Labs","group_lat":52.08000183105469,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"}],"meta":{"next":"","method":"Events","total_count":19,"link":"https://api.meetup.com/2/events","count":19,"description":"Access Meetup events using a group, member, or event id.
