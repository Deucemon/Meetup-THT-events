Focused on but not limited to people who are currently or were in the past employed as developers so that we can discuss things about our profession. All skills levels are welcome. Students too, of course.We hope this will become a nice party and organize lots of events.</p>\n<p>Our Goals and Philosophy:</p>\n<p>We are a group of people involved in programming - as professionals, as students or even amateurs, and we are interested in .NET technologies (Web, Cloud, Desktop, Mobile etc.), all relevant programming languages ‚Äã‚Äã(C#, VB.NET, F# etc.) and all related tools (Visual Studio, Xamarin etc.). Our goal is to understand better the full range of .NET technologies through socialization and pleasant company. The aim for all of us is to learn, not only through presentations or workshops but also through small or larger projects. The team members are willing to share their experience and knowledge and help each other on a team or individual level. The Hague .NET Developers meetup is extroverted and tries to establish connections with other groups of developers operating in our area (whether related with .NET or not) to promote technological and programming culture in our city, for the greater benefit. We are all volunteers and not a representative or official body of Microsoft or any other company.

The goal is to facilitate that mission by creating a platform in which the technologies of the future can match and begin to solve the problems of the present. We focus on solving 5 main global challenges, adapted from the 17 global challenges set forth by the United Nations.</p> \n<p><br>We have discovered that people around the world have started to develop technological solutions to these issues and yet can‚Äôt extend their reach far enough to find the places where their solutions can translate to the most change.

Through the use of global events, now located in 90+ cities, we have created a community for sharing tech solutions, including but not limited to big data, blockchain, internet of things, artificial intelligence, and virtual reality. The events of GlobalTech.City allow groups spanning from start-ups and scale-ups to educational institutions, corporations, investors and average citizens to extend the reach of their technological solutions and create a global network of problem solving.</p> \n<p><br>2.200+ members<br>90+ cities<br>900+ visitors<br>130+ speakers<br>90+ organisations<br>100+ tech solutions<br>30+ societal challenges<br>16 global challenges<br>5 future technologies</p> \n<p><br>hello@globaltech.city<br>www.globaltech.city<br>twitter.com/GlobalTechCity<br>instagram.com/globaltechcity<br>facebook.com/GlobalTechCity<br>meetup.com/pro/GlobalTechCity<br>globaltechcity.slack.com<br>linkedin.com/company-beta/17907436<br>flickr.com/photos/149096492@N07/albums<br>youtube.com/channel/UCgKU3szLEkndXIlvtqJmKIQ<br>news <a href=\"http://eepurl.com/cvpAVP\" class=\"linkified\">http://eepurl.com/cvpAVP</a></p>","created":1491084196000,"city":"Den Haag","untranslated_city":"Den Haag","country":"NL","localized_country_name":"Netherlands","localized_location":"Den Haag, Netherlands","state":"","join_mode":"open","visibility":"public","lat":52.08,"lon":4.28,"members":49,"organizer":{"id":218713656,"name":"G L O B A L T E C H C I T Y","bio":"","photo":{"id":264846368,"highres_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/1/8/e/0/highres_264846368.jpeg","photo_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/1/8/e/0/member_264846368.jpeg","thumb_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/1/8/e/0/thumb_264846368.jpeg","type":"member","base_url":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com"}},"who":"GlobalTech.Citizens","group_photo":{"id":459623052,"highres_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/a/0/c/highres_459623052.jpeg","photo_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/a/0/c/600_459623052.jpeg","thumb_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/a/0/c/thumb_459623052.jpeg","type":"event","base_url":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com"},"key_photo":{"id":461961430,"highres_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/3/b/6/highres_461961430.jpeg","photo_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/3/b/6/600_461961430.jpeg","thumb_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/3/b/6/thumb_461961430.jpeg","type":"event","base_url":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com"},"timezone":"Europe/Amsterdam","category":{"id":34,"name":"Tech","shortname":"tech","sort_name":"Tech"},"meta_category":{"id":292,"shortname":"tech","name":"Tech","sort_name":"Tech","photo":{"id":450131949,"highres_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/e/a/d/highres_450131949.jpeg","photo_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/e/a/d/600_450131949.jpeg","thumb_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/e/a/d/thumb_450131949.jpeg","type":"event","base_url":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com"},"category_ids":[34]}},{"score":1,"id":19337285,"name":"CMD Den Haag Interaction Design Meetup - Haagse Hogeschool","status":"active","link":"https://www.meetup.com/CMD-Den-Haag-Interaction-Design-Meetup-Haagse-Hogeschool/","urlname":"CMD-Den-Haag-Interaction-Design-Meetup-Haagse-Hogeschool","description":"Meetup van de opleiding CMD (Communicatie &amp; Multimedia Design) van de Haagse Hogeschool.

Je data delen op jouw voorwaarden.</p>\n<p>Wij willen √©n de voordelen van digitale dienstverlening √©n tegelijkertijd niet alle controle opgeven over de de data die wij (bewust of onbewust) produceren. Ons doel is daarom om een open architectuur te ontwikkelen waarmee individuele burgers controle krijgen over hun data. We onderzoeken de technische, sociale en commerci√´le archetypes die hier bij passen. We stimuleren dienstverlening die op een bewuste manier met onze data omgaat en die ons en onze data respecteert. Ons eerste stap is het defini√´ren van vijf niveaus waarop een organisatie ons en onze data kan respecteren:</p>\n<p>1. Kennis <br>We weten dat een organisatie onze data verzamelt.</p>\n<p>2. Inzicht <br>We weten hoe een organisatie onze data gebruikt.</p>\n<p>3. Toegang <br>We hebben toegang tot de data die een organisatie van ons heeft en mogen die data gebruiken voor onze eigen doeleinden.</p>\n<p>4. Delen <br>We mogen de data die een organisatie van ons heeft delen met anderen, op onze voorwaarden.</p>\n<p>5. Controle <br>We hebben volledige controle op de data die een organisatie van ons heeft. We kunnen die data vernietigen als we dat willen en daarmee verhinderen dat de data nog gebruikt wordt.</p>\n<p>Onze volgende stap is om te komen tot een werkende toepassing, waarmee we laten zien dat de keuze tussen data delen of niet inderdaad geen alles-of-niets keuze hoeft te zijn. Om deze stap te zetten hebben we jouw hulp nodig.
