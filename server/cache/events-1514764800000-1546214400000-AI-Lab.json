Millions of artificial agents are joining the interaction. We can sit and discuss threats and uncertainties for hours, and we should. But not in this lab. At least not after the thoughtful introductions by our keynote speakers who will join us in this lab.</p> <p>This is a straightforward day for AI practitioners to create and test concepts that improve public spaces around us. How can we use AI to improve our physical surroundings? How do we use it in our public lives? Which autonomous agents should join the interaction? Talking flower beds? Self-cleaning city air? Propagating squares for improved civic debate?</p> <p>AI lovers and friends of a healthy public space, join this lab. Bots are welcome too!</p> <p>In this lab, we will collaborate in hands-on experiments and do provocative research: we design a prototype for an AI agent that acts in public spaces and investigate how citizens react to this. The goal is to explore its usefulness and acceptability in society - and to figure out at what point this AI agent crosses the border...<br/>Central Questions for this lab are:<br/>1. What are useful dialogues with AI in public spaces?<br/>2. What form can such dialogues take?<br/>3. How are they experienced by people?<br/>4. What factors determine how far AI can go in public dialogues?</p> <p>The preliminary program of the AI in Public Spaces lab @ Border Sessions:</p> <p>10:00 Welcome &amp; introduction</p> <p>10:15 Keynote by Ed Keller, director at the Center for Transformative Media</p> <p>11:00 Provocative research on AI for Public Spaces, Demo &amp; discussion</p> <p>11:30 Work session in teams: Creating an AI dialogue in public spaces</p> <p>12:15 Lunch break</p> <p>13:15 Work session in teams: Testing the AI dialogue</p> <p>14:00 Plenary exchange of experiences</p> <p>14:15 Keynote by a speaker to be confirmed</p> <p>14:45 Tea break</p> <p>15:00 Breakout sessions:</p> <p>- Hands-on AI technology</p> <p>- Opportunities for AI in public spaces</p> <p>- Ethics of AI in public spaces</p> <p>17:00 Closure &amp; drinks</p>","how_to_find_us":"The Innovation Playground @ The Hague University of Applied Sciences","event_url":"https://www.meetup.com/AI-Lab/events/250617238/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"duration":25200000,"announced":true,"name":"Artificial Intelligence For Public Space Lab - Ticket purchase required!","id":"250617238","photo_url":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/c/7/4/global_470959572.jpeg","time":1529049600000,"updated":1529078128000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1517579683000,"name":"Ai Lab","group_lon":4.28000020980835,"id":27355853,"urlname":"AI-Lab","group_lat":52.08000183105469,"who":"Ai Enthusiasts"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":7200000,"venue":{"country":"nl","localized_country_name":"Netherlands","city":"Den Haag","address_1":"Juliana van Stolberglaan 10","name":"The Hague Tech","lon":4.331146,"id":24963073,"lat":52.082062,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1527182505000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Every Monday afternoon we are hosting the Ai Lab - co-working sessions where you can come to work and discuss your Machine Learning / Deep Learning / Ai related projects or start something new with the other community members.

How will artificial intelligence influence the legal and judicial landscape, in an era where machines can analyse forensic evidence, comprehend legal documents, and even generate verdicts? What questions of ethics are raised when autonomous machines can give diagnoses, conduct medical tests, and perform surgeries? How much autonomy do we give intelligent machines, and who do we blame when they make mistakes?</p> <p>As a specific example, we will see how AI and technology, in general, shape the legal industry and what opportunities arise for legal corporations and professionals interested in the legal industry.</p> <p>Come to The Hague Tech on the 16th of July, where our two speakers will bring you abreast of the latest technological advancements and opportunities in the legal field, address your questions, and perhaps raise some more questions for you to think about!</p> <p>The speakers:<br/>Georgios Stathis (1995) is a Ph.D. Candidate on Computational Law and Data Science and Research Assistant at the Introduction of the Data Protection Reform to the Judicial System (INFORM) project of eLaw Center at Leiden University.<br/>He studied Global Law (LL.B.) at Tilburg University (2016) and International and European Trade and Investment Law (LL.M.) at the University of Amsterdam (UvA) (2017).<br/>For more information: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/georgios-stathis-75586010b/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/georgios-stathis-75586010b/</a></p> <p>Olya (Olga) Kudina is a PhD candidate at the Philosophy Department of the University of Twente.
