Peter Siebel interviews 15 of the top programmers of our time in his book, Coders at Work: Reflections on the Craft of Programming (<a href=\"http://www.codersatwork.com/\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.codersatwork.com/</a>). They provide insight into how they think, their views on the craft of software development and more. For this event we'll keep it simple and focus on the third and fourth interviews:</p> <p>1) Douglas Crockford - A senior JavaScript Architect at Yahoo!, Douglas Crockford has been a<br/>programmer since the early ’70s when he took a Fortran course in college after<br/>being unable to get studio time for his major in television broadcasting. Over the<br/>course of his career, he has combined computers with media in various ways at<br/>places like Atari, Lucasfilm, Electric Communities, and now Yahoo! 2) Brendan Eich - Creator of JavaScript, Brendan Eich is now CTO of the<br/>Mozilla Corporation, the subsidiary of the Mozilla Foundation responsible for<br/>continuing development of the Firefox browser. The book is available anywhere you can buy software books online, however feel free to take a peek at the content (<a href=\"http://one-shore.com/aaron/books/coders-at-work.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">http://one-shore.com/aaron/books/coders-at-work.pdf</a>) before deciding whether to dive in.</p> <p>Please read the specified two interviews in advance of the event so that we can discuss what we read together. They comprise fewer than 90 pages of light reading, but will be critical for participation. The rest of the book is also interesting, so feel free to read more!</p> <p>The location is Cafe Dudok, in the central area of Den Haag. Seating is limited, so please RSVP early to claim your seat, and keep your RSVP status up to date.</p> <p>I'm looking forward to our discussion, and if you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to send a message!</p> <p>• What to bring</p> <p>• Important to know</p>","how_to_find_us":"There will be a notebook on the table with the initials of our group \"SDBC\" written in large black letters.","event_url":"https://www.meetup.com/Software-Development-Dinner-Club-Den-Haag/events/245964962/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"duration":7200000,"name":"Reflect on \"Coders at Work\" (Part 2)","id":"245964962","time":1516642200000,"updated":1516656238000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1499775758000,"name":"Software Development Dinner Club - Den Haag","group_lon":4.28000020980835,"id":24938960,"urlname":"Software-Development-Dinner-Club-Den-Haag","group_lat":52.08000183105469,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":3600000,"venue":{"country":"nl","localized_country_name":"Netherlands","city":"Den Haag","address_1":"Behind Den Haag Central Station","name":"MingleMush Food court","lon":4.32442,"id":25434192,"lat":52.080929,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1516735522000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>This month we'll try the good food and drink at <a href=\"http://www.minglemush.nl/\">MingleMush</a> (located just behind Central Station in Den Haag) and pontificate on the sometimes wildly diverging  philosophies of Donald Knuth and Edsger W.
